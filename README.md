Implements unused/removed signals and Signalscope frequencies using [New Horizons](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-new-horizons).

The frequencies are:
- Nomai Statue: Referred to in code as "Statue". Given off by all _active_ statues.
- Anti-Graviton Flux: Referred to in code as either "WarpCore" or "White Hole". Given off by all white holes (in warp cores or otherwise).
- ???: An unused achievement indicates that there were originally signals planned for the DLC location. Given off by four sets of antennae.
